# semantic-kernel-rag Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Code Quality
All code must be well-documented, clean, and maintainable. It must adhere to established coding standards and best practices for the language and framework in use. Code reviews are mandatory for all changes.

### II. Testing Standards
Every feature must be accompanied by a comprehensive suite of tests, including unit, integration, and end-to-end tests where applicable. A high level of test coverage is required, and all tests must pass before a change is merged.

### III. User Experience Consistency
The user interface and experience must be consistent across the entire application. This includes visual design, interaction patterns, and terminology. All new features must adhere to the established design system and UX guidelines.

### IV. Performance Requirements
The application must meet defined performance criteria for responsiveness and resource usage. Performance testing is required for features that may impact these metrics. Optimizations should be data-driven and focused on measurable improvements.

## Governance
All pull requests and reviews must verify compliance with this constitution. Any deviation must be justified and explicitly approved.
